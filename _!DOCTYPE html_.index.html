        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>Analyze the current administrative processes of Trina's Cafe, identify inefficiencies, and create a documented plan to streamline them, including recommendations for software and tools to improve efficiency and reduce operational bottlenecks.</p>

        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
